# An Italian Recipe making website

## Description
This is a website that allows a user to browse through italian recipes. The user would be able to create, add, edit and delete a recipe from their account as they deem fit and also, the user can add recipes from the collection of recipes available on the website. Additionally, there is a community of italian food lovers that the user can join to discuss their love for italian foods.

This website is made using the following tech stack:
    1. **HTML**.
    2. **CSS**.
    3. **JavaScript**.

Some of the challenges I faced was designing this website. Along the way, I had to restructure a lot of my code to accomodate some changes that had to be made. Especially, when I was trying to make it responsive. Based on reviews so far, I believe it's pretty much a good design but I think I would prefer to work with a designer on any future project while I get better at web designs.

I would like to make all form and input fields to submit and be functional. And also, make the subscribe button prompt a modal of a form to subscribe to newsletters.
